          Hello, so I've had quite a few requests from family members who are now doing a lot of video calls to help fix
          their slow internet. To help everyone, I thought I'd share my instructions with you all. Please feel free to
          share this site with everyone you know.
        </p>

        <ol class="steps">
          <li>
            Make your device is in good working order:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Check you are connected to your WIFI, especially for tablets and phones
              </li>
              <li>
                Install the latest updates for your device
              </li>
              <li>
                Close other apps and browser windows as this will use up internet and slow your device down
              </li>
              <li>
                Find out if other people are using your internet. The more people using it at once the better internet
                you will need
              </li>
              <li>
                Don’t use the microwave, cordless phones or baby monitors at the same time as these use the same signal
                as WIFI and cause interference
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Run a speed test:
            <ol>
              <li>
                <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=internet+speed+test" target="_blank"
                  rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">
                  Google "internet speed test"
                </a>
              </li>
              <li>
                Click the blue "run speed test" button
              </li>
            </ol>
          <li>
            Check your upload and download rates:
            <ol>
              <li>
                For video calls you need at least 2 Mbps download AND 2 Mbps upload
              </li>
              <li>
                For large group video calls you need 8 Mbps download AND 2 Mbps upload
              </li>
              <li>
                For SD films you need at least 3 Mbps download
              </li>
              <li>
                For HD films you need at least 5 Mbps download
              </li>
              <li>
                For 4K films you need at least 25 Mbps download
              </li>
              <li>
                This is what is needed per device, so multiply by the number of devices you have
              </li>
            </ol>
          <li>
            Check your latency, this is how much of a delay there is:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Less than 10 ms is great
              </li>
              <li>
                30 ms is good
              </li>
              <li>
                100 ms or more will cause problems
              </li>
            </ol>
          <li>
            If you have other devices (laptops / phone / tablet):
            <ol>
              <li>
                Perform step 2 on each of your devices
              </li>
              <li>
                If devices have different speeds it’s probably an issue with that device
              </li>
            </ol>
          <li>
            Find your router:
            <ol>
              <li>
                The router is the small box provided by your broadband company connected to the phone line or the box
                probided by your cable TV provider
              </li>
              <li>
                Ensure it is not covered with anything that will block your WIFI signal
              </li>
              <li>
                Make sure none of the cables are loose, e.g. where it connnects to the socket
              </li>
              <li>
                Move your device right next to the router or if you can plug your device in with a cable
              </li>
              <li>
                Re-run the speed tests in step 2
              </li>
            </ol>
          <li>
            If the speed results are similar when you are right next to the router:
            <ol>
              <li>
                It is probably an issue with your broadband</li>
              <li>
                If it is less than the speed you pay for then contact your internet provider and get them to resolve the
                issue.
              </li>
            </ol>
          <li>
            If the results are much quicker when you are right next to the router:
            <ol>
              <li>
                It is probably an issue with the WIFI in your home
              </li>
              <li>
                Check there are no devices from step 1e causing interference
              </li>
              <li>
                Make sure nothing is blocking the signal as in step 6b
              </li>
              <li>
                If possible, be close to the router when doing video calls
              </li>
              <li>
                If you can, plug your device into your router with a cable, especially for a TV
              </li>
              <li>
                If your router is more than a few years old, contact your internet provider and see if they offer a
                newer model
              </li>
              <li>
                If you have a large house, an old house with thick walls, or a modern flat with metal stud walls then
                this might be stopping your wireless internet signal. It is possible to buy MESH WI-FI which will extend
                your signal. Some internet providers offer them, if not you will need to buy a system and set it up
                yourself.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Good luck, and I hope this helps you!
